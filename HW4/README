The parameters of this program has six options:
python kmeans.py --dataset /path/to/data/filename.csv --k-val 2 --distance Euclidean --max-iterations 500 --threshold 0.001 --random-seed 1

1. dataset path
This value could be set by the user and it must be a path to read the data file.
2. k value
This is the k value defined as the number of nearest neighbors which can be set by the user and must be an integer.
This value cannot be less than 1.
3. distance value
This is the distance choice provided to user to choose between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance.
The default value is Euclidean distance.
4. max iterations value
This is the maximum iterations of k-means and the default is 500. If the number of iterations is larger than 500 and still
not converge, the algorithm will stop.
5. converge threshold value
This is the threshold value chosen by the user to determine what percentage of movement of the centroids at the time from
old centroid point to the new centroid point should be considered as converge. The default value is 0.001.
6. random seed value
This is the random seed value select by user which is used to choose different initial centroids.
This value must be an integer and default is 1.
