When we set the number of iterations to be 1000000 and lambda to be 0.2. We get the result of
w: [0.04945827 0.1110764  0.25283874].
Using this value to test the remaining twenty data points and there is no data point has been misclassified.

The parameters of this program has two options:
--max_iterations 10000 --lambda1 0.02
1. maximum number of iterations
This value could be set by the user and it must be an integer. The default value of maximum number of iterations is 10000.
2. lambda
This is the lambda value from the loss function which can be set by the user and must be float. The default value is 0.2.
